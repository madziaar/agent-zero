# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Clean up and optimize the Agent Zero workspace by removing backup directories, fixing version control issues, eliminating code redundancies, and improving overall project organization.

This implementation addresses critical inefficiencies in the codebase including 381 unnecessary backup files across three directories, version control drift with 16 uncommitted changes, code duplication issues, and technical debt that could impact performance and maintainability.

[Types]
No new type definitions required for this cleanup and optimization task.

[Files]
Remove backup and cache directories while preserving essential project structure.

- Delete `.history/` directory (164 files) - contains old development artifacts and backups
- Delete `.qwen/` directory (127 files) - contains development templates that are no longer needed
- Delete `prompts_backup/` directory (90 files) - contains old prompt backups replaced by new structure
- Update `.gitignore` to prevent future accumulation of backup files
- Commit deleted prompt files that are showing as deleted in git status
- Add untracked new prompt directories to git
- Remove `.continue/` directory if it's a temporary VSCode file

[Functions]
No function modifications required - this is primarily a cleanup and reorganization task.

[Classes]
No class modifications required for this cleanup task.

[Dependencies]
Analyze and optimize the requirements.txt file for potential dependency cleanup.

- Review 40+ dependencies for unused packages
- Check for outdated packages that can be updated
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Remove any redundant or conflicting packages

[Testing]
Validate cleanup effectiveness and ensure no functionality is broken.

- Verify git status is clean after cleanup
- Test that the application still runs correctly
- Check that all essential files are preserved
- Validate that version control history is maintained

[Implementation Order]
Execute cleanup in careful sequence to minimize risks and ensure proper version control management.

1. Create backup of current state before making changes
2. Analyze backup directories to confirm they can be safely deleted
3. Remove backup directories (.history/, .qwen/, prompts_backup/)
4. Update .gitignore to prevent future accumulation of similar files
5. Clean up git status by committing deleted files and adding new ones
6. Push changes to remote repository to sync with origin/main
7. Analyze dependencies for potential cleanup opportunities
8. Test application functionality after cleanup
9. Provide summary of changes made and space recovered
