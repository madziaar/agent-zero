```

#### Context Compression Techniques

**Technique 1: Selective Information Density**
```markdown
**Before (Low Density):**
```
I need to create a web application. The application should have user authentication,
dashboard functionality, and data visualization. I want to use React for the frontend
and Node.js for the backend. The database should be MongoDB. Also, I want to make sure
the application is responsive and works well on mobile devices.
```
*Token Count: ~85 (inefficient)*

**After (High Density):**
```
**Web Application Requirements:**
- Tech Stack: React 18+, Node.js/Express, MongoDB
- Core Features: Auth system, dashboard, data visualization
- Quality Standards: Responsive design, mobile-optimized
- Performance: Sub-200ms response times, 90%+ Lighthouse score
```
*Token Count: ~45 (efficient)*
```

**Technique 2: Hierarchical Context Loading**
```markdown
**Phase 1 (Core Context):**
```
Project: E-commerce API
Architecture: REST API with FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
Core Feature: Product catalog management
```

**Phase 2 (Enhanced Context):**
```
**Integration Requirements:**
- Existing user auth system at ./auth/
- Payment service integration at ./payments/
- Inventory management at ./inventory/

**Performance Standards:**
- API response <100ms p95
- Database query <50ms average
- Memory usage <200MB per instance
```

**Phase 3 (Quality Context):**
```
**Testing Requirements:**
- 95%+ test coverage with pytest
- Load testing with 1000 concurrent users
- Security testing with OWASP standards

**Documentation:**
- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- API usage examples and best practices
- Deployment and scaling guide
```
```
