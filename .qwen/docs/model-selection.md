## Performance and Cost Optimization

### Computational Efficiency

#### Model Selection by Resource Constraints

| Environment              | Recommended Model | Rationale                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Local Development**    | Qwen 7B          | Fast iteration, lower resource usage  |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**      | Qwen 14B         | Balanced speed and quality            |
| **Production Systems**   | Qwen 72B         | Maximum quality for critical code     |
| **Resource Constrained** | Qwen 7B          | Minimal computational requirements    |

### Context Window Efficiency

#### Token Usage Optimization

**Inefficient Approach:**
```markdown
Generate a React component. The component should have state management,
API calls, error handling, loading states, form validation, accessibility
features, responsive design, and comprehensive testing. Also include
documentation and examples.
```
*Token Usage: ~150 tokens for requirements + generation*

**Optimized Approach:**
```markdown
Generate a React component with:

**Core Requirements:**
- State management with useReducer
- API integration with error handling
- Loading and error states
- Form validation with react-hook-form

**Technical Specifications:**
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Material-UI for styling
- Jest and React Testing Library

**Quality Standards:**
- 90%+ test coverage
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

Focus on clean architecture and performance optimization.
```
*Token Usage: ~200 tokens for detailed requirements + better generation*
```

## Agent Zero Integration Patterns

### Invoking Qwen Coder with Model Selection

#### Automatic Model Selection
```json

  "thoughts": [
    "User needs complex authentication system",
    "Requires comprehensive security patterns",
    "Qwen 72B optimal for security-critical features",
    "Need detailed implementation with testing"
  ],
  "tool_name": "call_subordinate",
  "tool_args": {
    "message": "Implement enterprise-grade authentication system with Qwen 72B optimization",
    "profile": "qwen-coder",
    "reset": false
  }
}
```

#### Explicit Model Targeting
```json
{
  "thoughts": [
    "Rapid prototyping task identified",
    "Qwen 7B sufficient for quick iteration",
    "User needs fast results for experimentation"
  ],
  "tool_name": "call_subordinate",
  "tool_args": {
    "message": "Generate prototype component with Qwen 7B for rapid iteration",
    "profile": "qwen-coder",

  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Model Selection

### Common Selection Issues

#### 1. Over-Provisioning Resources
**Problem:** Using Qwen 72B for simple tasks
**Impact:** Slower responses, unnecessary costs
**Solution:** 
- Assess task complexity first
- Start with smaller models for prototypes
- Scale up only for complex requirements

#### 2. Under-Provisioning Capability
**Problem:** Using Qwen 7B for complex systems
**Impact:** Poor code quality, incomplete implementations
**Solution:**
- Evaluate architectural complexity
- Use Qwen 14B+ for multi-component systems
- Consider context window requirements

#### 3. Context Window Overflow
**Problem:** Exceeding model context limits
**Impact:** Truncated responses, incomplete code
**Solution:**
- Structure prompts hierarchically
- Use incremental development approach
- Reference existing files explicitly
