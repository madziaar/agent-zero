```

## Configuration Strategy

### Team-Specific Customization

```yaml
# Example Agent Zero configuration for code review
code_review:
  enabled: true
  categories:
    - security
    - performance
    - architecture
    - quality
  standards:
    - owasp_top_10
    - team_coding_standards
    - industry_best_practices
  severity_levels:
    - critical: block_commit
    - high: require_approval
    - medium: warning
    - low: info
```
