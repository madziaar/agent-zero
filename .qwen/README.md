## Getting Started

### Using Qwen Coder Subagents

To invoke a Qwen Coder subagent for coding tasks:

1. **Basic Invocation**:

   ```
   Use the qwen-coder profile for optimized coding assistance.
   ```

2. **Specific Model Targeting**:

   ```
   Deploy qwen-coder subagent optimized for Qwen 72B for complex architectural tasks.
   ```

3. **Task-Specific Delegation**:
   ```
   Create qwen-coder subagent for API development with Qwen 14B optimization.
   ```

### Template Usage

Each template includes:

- **Optimized Project Structure**: Layout designed for Qwen model processing
- **Prompt Files**: Ready-to-use prompts for common tasks
- **Configuration Examples**: Qwen-optimized settings and parameters
- **Documentation**: Usage guides and best practices

## Qwen Model Optimization

### Model Selection Guidelines

- **Qwen 7B**: Fast iteration, prototyping, simple implementations
- **Qwen 14B**: Balanced performance, most development tasks
- **Qwen 72B**: Complex architecture, deep analysis, critical systems

### Context Window Management

- **Efficient Prompting**: Structure information for optimal context usage
- **Incremental Generation**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain important information across interactions

## Integration with Agent Zero

The Qwen Coder workspace integrates seamlessly with the Agent Zero framework:

- **Hierarchical Delegation**: Qwen Coder agents work as subordinates to main agents
- **Tool Integration**: Access to full Agent Zero tool ecosystem
- **Memory System**: Persistent learning and context retention
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Collaboration with other specialized agents

## Contributing

To extend the Qwen Coder workspace:

1. **Add Templates**: Create new project templates in the `templates/` directory
2. **Optimize Prompts**: Develop and test new prompt patterns for Qwen models
3. **Document Patterns**: Share successful optimization techniques and examples
4. **Tool Development**: Create utilities that enhance Qwen coding capabilities

## Support
